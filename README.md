# HDMI infinity display

## Introduction
The goal is to have a back projection of colors out from a TV that helps really immerse you in the content. The easy public way to do this is a set of Philips HUE lights and their [HDMI sync kit](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221?cjevent=a1c38c37d70111eb80af00a40a1c0e14#overview_).

The problem with this is that it's super expensive for what you get. Consider the following table of required equipment for that solution:

Philips Products | Price (as of June 2021)
---- | ----
[HDMI sync kit](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221?cjevent=a1c38c37d70111eb80af00a40a1c0e14#overview) | $229.99
[Hue Bridge](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478) | $59.99
[Play Light Bar](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-light-bar-double-pack/7820230U7?cjevent=3a896febd76211eb83bb00e10a1c0e13) | $149.99
Total | $439.97

That is an extraordinary price for such a mundane goal, especially because it's not a turnkey solution - one must still pair the components, use a smartphone to set everything up, etc. 

In this project we will build the same functionality using easy off-the-shelf components in such a way that it's very easy to set up and very easy to customize.
